# 10CT-Assessment-Task-2

Wassup sir. 

Hope you are having a good day.

Open the index.html to begin.

The buttons that can direct to another screen include:

- Home (Navbar)
- Explore (Navbar)
- What's On (Navbar)
- Join and Give (Navbar)
- About Us (Navbar)

- Learn More (Home)
- Natural Rock Formations and Sculptures (Explore)

Furthermore, in the explore tab, you can scroll on the images with the arrow keys, as coding a drag side-scroll was way too hard to code :P. I kept the scroll bar there even though it looks really ugly.

ALSO it looks pretty bad on monitor....sorry i know i messed up with the relative/absolute thing it looks wayyyy better on a small laptop screen (which is what I was viewing it on), and when you view it on a monitor the things do move a bit around sorry haha yeah my mistake

Don't ask about Fran Dorey and the pizza at the bottom (or you can if you want lmao), basically I did this whole Australian Online Museum website because my most wonderful amazing beautiful incredible talented netball coach of 7 years is actually the Head of Exhibitions at the Australian Museum lol and i started to plan my assessment on the last netball training we ever had TT-TT oh i miss her so much already

Also my logo? It's literally the Australian Museum Logo but upside down, then I added 2 dots and recoloured it, and wala! A tiny little monster face has been born! Yeah its 6am I'm bored

Was that too much? Idk. I probably forgot to mention something actually important in here but oh well. This is actually incredibly fun I enjoyed this for 12 hours straight and it was really fun who would have thought thanks for this.


Anyway have a great day thanksssss cya
